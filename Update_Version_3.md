# Update Version 3

## Introduction
This document details the updates made to the project.

## Mathematical Notations
In this section, all mathematical equations will be properly rendered.

### Inline Math
The equations such as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ are now formatted correctly.

### Aligned Environment Fix
At line 223, the line break issue has been fixed:
```latex
\begin{aligned}
& \text{some equation}\\
& \text{next line}
\end{aligned}
```

### Subgradient Update Formula
The subgradient update formula is now correctly represented:
$\theta = \theta - \eta [\nabla f(\theta)]_+$

### Location Var Section
The "Location var" section has been completed. Here is the full description:
- **Location Variable**: Describes the variable used to determine the location of the solution.

### Descriptions
Additional content has been added to enhance clarity and understanding of the equations.

## Conclusion
This version addresses all rendering issues and provides a clearer understanding of the mathematical concepts discussed.
