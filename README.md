## This README file will give a brief introduction and instructions on how to guide the file you might need
If you are looking for Version1, please go to 1_cleaned.py
If you are looking for anything that  has to do with Version/Iteration 3. Please go to the Iteration_3.py, Update_version_3.md, and html file. 

### Iteration 3 is the latest update!
That contains a new objective function using Lagrange Relaxation, Farkas Lemma (version 1), Linear Programming, and some Duality definitions and theorems. 
I also attached a handwritten proof of my work. Just a reminder that my handwritten proof is a rough draft. If you are looking for a more rigorous document with a  better layered format. Please refer to Update_version_3.html

#### The Work was all conducted by Mingchen Yuan
Please!!! Let me know if you have any other questions. Any kind of TYPO, or wrong coding logic, etc....

#### All Mathematical definition references can be credited to the following links:
"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5150/linalg-II.pdf", a great book from Penn. I also recommend this book to anyone who is learning basic Operational Research material. Please be aware that you have to at least acknowledge some topology and linear algebra definitions.
