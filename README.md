If you are looking for Version1 please go to 1_cleaned.py
If you are looking for anything has to do with Version/Iteration 3. Please go to the Iteration_3.py, Update_version_3.md and html file. 

### Iteration 3 is the latest update!
That contains a new objective function using Lagrange Relaxation, Farkas Lemma (version1), Linear Programming and some Duality definition and theorems. 
I also attached a hand written proof of my work. Just a reminder that my hand-written proof is a rough draft. If you are looking for a more rigorous document 
with better layered format. Please refer to Update_version_3.html

#### The Work was all conducted by Mingchen Yuan
Please!!! let me know if you have any other questions. Any kinds of TYPO, or wrong coding logic, etc....
