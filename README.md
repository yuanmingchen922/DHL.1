## Iteration Version 3

## This Markdown file is the iteration of model, objective function, constraints with detailed mathematics proof and few key notes from the theorem. My formula represents a mathematically rigorous Lagrangian dual of the facility-distribution optimization model

## Please go to version_3.md for more detailed math proof. A reminder needs to be stated here is that the function in the pdf did not redener well. If caused any confusion, I sincerely apologize. However, I can make sure that the function here is the correct one. Another way is that to download the Version_3.md and put it in vscode with Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed, or run it in Overleaf. Once again, I am sorry that Github does not render part of the latex code correctly.
